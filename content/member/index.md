## Membership Has Its Privileges
---
Being a member is really the only way to consistently enjoy The Drowning Sparrow.  Because our hours are erratic, sometimes planned, sometimes impromptu - being on a list that notifies you of the opportunities to join us is really the only way to know what's going on and when to show up.  And the only people who get notified of all these awesome things are members.

Luckily, becoming a member is easy! It's also free! There are a couple of primary ways to do it: 

1. Simply know someone who is a member.  
2. Convince that person you are cool. 
3. Get them to sponsor you.

*OR*

1. Simply know someone who is a member.
2. Sleep with them.
3. Get them to bring you as a guest next time they come - then refer to the above for next steps.
