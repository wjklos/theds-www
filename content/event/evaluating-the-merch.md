## Evaluating the Merch
---
Our first sample order of shirts is coming in from Bonfire.  We will be looking at quality, sizing, feel and so on.  Hopefully we can make recommendations on how they fit for anyone that wants to order one.  From here, we will finalize the design, color options, and then get the store opened up.  Stay tuned!!
