## The Jaw
---
Kate’s dad (Paul) was a pretty small guy until he graduated high school. Well, everything except his jaw. The joke was that his “jaw” entered the room before he did. That nickname survived, even when the rest of his face caught up. So in honor of "Jaw", please sample his favorite drink combination. 

* Pabst Blue Ribbon - 1 can
* Jack Daniels - 1 shot
