## The Aviary
---
Our little club sits in the flight path of many things.  CMH for one.  We see the jets coming in and leaving our fair city of Columbus.  Secondly, the "copper chopper" or "ghetto bird" makes all too frequent appearances sometimes.  And lastly, the constant to and fro from our resident songbirds as they visit their own little local clubs, aka our bird feeders.  Those little guys can become quite fearless as they go from nest to feeder to fountain and back again.  It makes for quite an entertaing afternoon to watch their busy lives from our pub or patio.  Thus, The Aviary is named for our little spot to sit and watch the world fly by.

* Empress Gin
* Luxardo Liqueur
* Violet Syrup
* Luxardo Cherry

Fun fact, we almost named our little club "The Flyover Bar" due to all the air traffic we get!
