## Old-World Sparrow
---
Those damned English sparrows are here year round and so is this delicious cocktail.  Named after the prolific, invasive species brought over from the old-world - this drink is anything but common.  Starting with a solid, only slightly pretentious bourbon which is sweetened with our homemade brown sugar concoction.  Add in a luscious walnut liqueur (also from the old-world) and a single, decadent rich cherry - and you have our signature drink!

* Jeffersonâ€™s Reserve Bourbon 
* Brown Sugar Simple Syrup 
* Orahovac 
* Single Luxardo Cherry
