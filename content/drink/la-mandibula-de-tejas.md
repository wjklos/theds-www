## La Mandibula de Tejas
---
This twist on the Drowning Sparrow staple, [The Jaw]({{< ref "the-jaw" >}} "The Jaw").  This drink features one of the other siblings from the "3 Amigos" (Jack Daniels, Jose Cuervo, Johnny Walker) - and the National Beer of Texas.  It is difficult to obtain Lone Star up here in our great flyover state, so get this one while you can!

* Lone Star Beer - 1 can
* Jose Cuervo - 1 shot
