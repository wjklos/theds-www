## Snow Moon
---
A light and lovely drink with the color of virgin Christmas snow illuminated by the moonlight of the upcoming solstice.  But this drink, like *most* of the people here tonight, is no virgin.  Named to honor the upcoming Cold Moon (next week's full moon), have one or more to welcome the dark days of Winter with a splash of an icy white/blue magic elixir.

* ** Gin, Paula's Orange, Creme de Violette, Lime Juice, Snowflake Eucharist**
