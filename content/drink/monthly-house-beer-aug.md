## Monthly House Beer
---
We're not fancy.  We don't brew our own beer so we have to highlight what we have.  Usually, this distinction falls on whatever we have the most of at the moment in an effort to get rid of it.  This month it's:

* **Bud Light - by bottle or can, cold**

Next month?  Could be the same or it could be a mix of other beers left over from whatever members' "meeting" we had.  Feel free to bring over a case of whatever you like and maybe your beer will be the featured beer next month!

If this month's beer special is not to your taste. please feel free to peruse our other leftover beers to see if something strikes your fancy.
