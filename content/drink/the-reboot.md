## The Reboot
---
Simply the best blanco/silver tequila you will find - at any price point.  And is likely better than most reposados, anejos, and extra anejos.  Discovered as part of a tequila tasting at El Meson, just south of Dayton, OH.  We heard the story of how it was imported into the States and got to sample the entire line before it officially arrived.  Bill was on a mission to find it ever since.  Now, just about any Kroger or Giant Eagle in the area should have some.

No lime.  No salt.  No regret.
