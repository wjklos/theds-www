---
Sometimes you need volume of liquid to stay hydrated.  Maybe from a workout, or may a discussion you just had that sucked all the brain cell right out of your head.

* Diet Coke / can
* Dr. Pepper Zero / can
* Diet Sunkist / glass
* Water / bottle
* Green Tea / glass
* Hot Tea / cup

We may also have ginger beer or ginger ale based on what has been happening at The Sparrow and what donations have been brought in.  Just ask.
