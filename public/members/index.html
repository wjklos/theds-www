<p>Being a member is really the only way to consistently enjoy The Drowning Sparrow.  Because our hours are erratic, sometimes planned, sometimes impromptu - being on a list that notifies you of the opportunities to join us is really the only way to know what&rsquo;s going on and when to show up.  And the only people who get notified of all these awesome things are members.</p>
