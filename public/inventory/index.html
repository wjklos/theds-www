<hr>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; fine bottles of alcohol for awhile.  Wherever possible, we try to have backups for the best or most popular of our spirits but sometimes our supply can run low.  Especially on hard-to-get items.  We are always on the look out for certain things, and can always use more of our staples.  Our membership fee here at The Drowning Sparrow is low. In fact, there is no membership fee.  But if you ever feel so inclined to help us keep the good stuff in stock, below is a list of the things we need.</p>
<p>Some of them are constantly being depleted, and some of them are just hard to find!  If you come across an item that is on the list and is hugely expensive, call us, we may just Venmo you the cash to get it.  And when you get here, we&rsquo;ll pop it open and see if it was worth the investment!</p>
